# Cornell Marginalia for Obsidian 🩺

A lightweight Obsidian plugin designed for students who use the **Cornell Note-taking System**. It allows you to add side-notes (cues) that are rendered in the margin but remain **invisible** to other plugins like  PDF exports.


## How it works

Use the syntax `%%> Your text here %%` anywhere in your note.

### Example

Mitochondria are membrane-bound cell organelles that generate most of the chemical energy. %%> "Powerhouse" of the cell (ATP) %
